      <p>My Hobby is to play cricket. It keeps me fit and fine. Playing Cricket is a very good hobby and the most important thing to learn it is to focus on it. Whenever I get free time, I start playing cricket, and when my holidays are going on I always play cricket while other children just play video games and make their eyseight very weak. I also go to cricket acaedmy, there we just didn't play cricket, We also run in the field as it keeps our bones fit. I also read many encyclopedias on cricket to as it helps me in understanding the concepts of cricket more deeply. I always have a dream to be a cricketer.
